                 Guwahati is a city in the north-eastern state of Assam. It lies on the banks of the mighty Brahmaputra River and at the foothills of the Shillong Plateau. Owing to its location, the city is a natural hotspot with several rare animals and birds either residing here or regularly visiting it, making tourism a significant contributor to its economy.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Besides being an important region for wildlife, Guwahati is a major commercial, educational, political and cultural centre of the east and especially the north-east. The city’s view on various political matters also holds great importance for the region.


                </p>
                <p>
                Owing to the city’s multi-dimensional nature and great diversity, the nature of development in Guwahati is multi-faceted. In fact, it’s currently one of the fastest developing cities in India and displays plenty of promise for its residents, both in terms of infrastructure and real estate development.

                </p>
                <p>
                Until a decade ago, investing in the real estate market of Guwahati was not in the consideration of most investors. They would rather invest in a piece of land expecting stable long-term returns.

                </p>
                <p>
                The scenario has changed significantly with the ‘Look East Policy’ initiated in 1991 and rigorously followed by successive Governments. The idea was to cultivate extensive economic and strategic relations with the nations of Southeast Asia to bolster India’s standing as a regional power and a counterweight to the strategic influence of the People’s Republic of China. It was this strategic direction by the Central Government of India that has gradually made Guwahati the most important city of the Northeast connecting the capital of the seven sister states.

                   Why Investing in the Real Estate Market of Guwahati is a Pragmatic Choice for Long-Term Investors

                <b>Growing Working Population Driving the Real Estate Market of Guwahati</b>
            
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 Guwahati not only grew in terms of infrastructure and geographical spread, but also in terms of enterprise and employability. Over 25% of the urban population of the state is concentrated in Guwahati. Although the urbanisation of the state of Assam grew only by 1.2%, the region of Kamrup grew by over 5%. With the continuing increase in the working population of Guwahati, the demand for residential and commercial real estate is slated to grow. It is an opportunity for the investors to leverage this growing demand for real estate among the burgeoning urban population of Guwahati. The data is presented from the website of Directorate of Town and Country Planning, Govt. of Assam.

                 <p>
                    <b>Rental Income</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 A growing working population also drives the rental income of the real estate owners. A reason why real estate is generally considered a great investment option is the certainty that it can generate ongoing passive income in terms of rentals, while its value increases over time. Guwahati has seen a significant jump in the demand for rental housing and commercial spaces in the last decade. Going by the trend, it can be fairly assumed that the growth of this rental segment makes the real estate market extremely attractive for the investors.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <b>High Literacy Rate</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 Higher literacy is a harbinger of growth and prosperity. This makes Guwahati a suitable real estate investment destination for investors for a long-term stable return of investment.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <b>Better Standards of Construction</b>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 In terms of construction quality and amenities, the real estate market of Guwahati has come a long way. Guwahati has seen best-in-class properties in the recent years. Builders have started using high-end technology to build residential and commercial spaces that will be appreciated. Today, Guwahati is home to a host of best-in-class properties that boast great infrastructure and customized facilities to suit the requirements of every industry. Amenities like swimming pools with deck, gazebo, club house, automated lifts, open spaces with landscaped gardens are relatively newer in Guwahati, and this continued evolution and addition of new technology and new amenities, while catching up to markets like Mumbai, makes the real estate market of Guwahati very dynamic, growing and therefore lucrative for a long-term investment.
